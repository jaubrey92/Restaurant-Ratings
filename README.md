## **_Description_**

#### For my unit two project, I will be creating a Tulsa restaurant review website, similar to Yelp, but also influenced by Glassdoor. The main difference will be it is a website that reviews not just the product of each restaurant, but also the working experience for each restaurant. It will have two One:Many relationships, one where one user can have many reviews of the product of each restaurant and similarly where one user can have many reviews of the working experience of each restaurant. These reviews be able to be created and deleted. Users will be able to login via their Google accounts which I will enable through OAuth. Users that are not logged in will be able to see these reviews on the detail page of the website, but only logged in users will be able to post reviews.
